My name is Ajay Manwani. I'm a semiconductor product engineer and data scientist enthusiast. I'm originally from Nagpur, India, but I moved to Bangalore in 2016 and then Hyderabad in 2022.
I love all Tea, particularly Indian masala tea and like to workout some days a week just to keep myself active. I enjoy reading about finance and stock market.
