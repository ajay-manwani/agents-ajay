### Design Overview:

- **Class Structure**: We have a single class `Account` which encapsulates all functionalities related to user account management.
- **Attributes**:
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user account.
  - `balance`: The current balance available for transactions.
  - `portfolio`: A dictionary mapping stock symbols to their respective quantities held by the user.
  - `transactions`: A list to record all transactions performed by the user for auditing and verification purposes.
  - `initial_deposit`: The initial amount deposited when the account was created.
- **Method Signatures**: Each method is clearly defined with appropriate parameters and return types. Exceptions are raised for edge cases, ensuring robust error handling.
- **Data Flow**: The design provides a clear path for how data (e.g., funds, shares) is managed, allowing seamless operations for depositing, withdrawing, buying, and selling shares, as well as tracking the portfolio and transactions over time.

This module design is comprehensive and can be directly implemented by a backend engineer without further elaboration.
